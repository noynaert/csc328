Computer Graphics course at Missouri Western State University

I would plan to use Java and JavaFX.  It isn't ideal for image processing, but it would allow covering the principles of computer vision while also giving some experience in Java programming.

Computer Vision is kind of the opposite of Comptuer Graphics.  "Compliment" might be a better analysis, however.  Both graphics and vision use the same math that we traditionally covered in our Computer Graphics course.

Using OpenCV for image processing allows practical applications of the principles of Computer Graphics.  If we build into full CV applications we will be set up to do so.  Or, if students want to continue independent research, then they can easily continue.
